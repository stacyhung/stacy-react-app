        description: "This is an incredibly quick and easy pancake recipe that never fails to make extra-fluffy pancakes filled with the juiciness and slight sweetness of antioxidant-rich blueberries. The best part is that I can use almond milk, which I always have handy because I'm lactose intolerant! Also, if you somehow end up not finishing these delicious cakes, you can even freeze the leftovers.",

        description: "This is one of the best ways to use up your over-ripe bananas. The key to this recipe is making sure the eggs, bananas (if frozen) and butter have thawed to room temperature. Freshly baked is the best time to eat, but when I don't have guests to share it with, I just freeze the rest as plastic-wrapped slices. Then when you're ready to have a slice, just reheat from frozen at 225â„‰ for 6 minutes!",

        description: "These nearly-vegan scones are the perfect gourmet biscuit for a weekend morning. You can substitute frozen blueberries with fresh (I love the fact that you can use frozen bluerries though, since I always have them around!). Also, fresh rosemary is a must and the real star of this recipe. These also freeze well, so you can make a few batches and save them for later! You can make this recipe completely vegan by creating a 'flax egg' (1 tablespoon of ground flaxseed and 3 tablespoons of water to replace 1 egg).",
