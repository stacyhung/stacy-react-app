        Think of your favourite outdoor activity. Now ask yourself: would avoid
        the activity if it were raining? I’m guessing your answer is yes. Well,
        my answer is yes and no.

        I fell in love with road cycling almost immediately after moving here
        from Ontario. Moving to the west coast was the scariest and best
        decision I’ve ever made. I wasn’t too sure what to expect, but there was
        one thing everyone made sure I knew, which was how much it rained here.
        So I came prepared with my two luggages including a pair of rain boots,
        an umbrella and a raincoat -- <em>ok, ready!</em> Well, not quite. One
        thing I didn’t come prepared for was cycling in the rain, but after a
        few wet rides I learned that cycling in the rain is good for you! How
        you ask? Well, it makes you better.
      </p>

      <p>
        For me, cycling in the rain made me better in three ways, specifically
        by:
        <ol>
          <li>Helping me to understand the intricacies of biking</li>
          <li>Making me mentally stronger and</li>
          <li>
            Giving me more appreciation for sunny days and just days where I can
            bike at all.
          </li>
        </ol>
      </p>

      <p>
        When it rains, the roads become slick like ice, so bike tires have a
        harder time of sticking to the road. While I’ve been lucky to not have
        any accidents in wet weather, I now pay attention to my tires before
        going out. On dry days, I like them nice and firm so I can bike faster
        and smoother and avoid flats. On wet days though, I keep them at a lower
        pressure so they will have more surface area contact with the road.

        My first rainy ride was a big one -- it was the{" "}

          RTCC
        </a>
        . The forecast for the 2-day ride didn’t look bright, but I didn’t think
        much of it naively believing I’d be fine with my current gear -{" "}
        <em>
          Rain? Meh! I sweat like a fountain on my bike rides - I probably won’t
          even notice if it rains!
        </em>{" "}
        Boy, was I wrong. My friends partially saved me by bringing an extra
        pair of leggings and a long-sleeve jersey, but even half-way through day
        one, it didn’t take long for my body to start shivering and my lips to
        turn blue. I learned that waterproof and breathable clothing is
        essential for a rainy ride.
      </p>

      <p>
        It was also on my first rainy ride where I learned to appreciate the
        usefulness of fenders for reducing spray on your back as well as the
        face of the rider behind you. I experienced the latter first hand, when
        I had to ride behind some people without fenders. It’s a bit like
        running through a sprinkler, except instead of clean water, it’s sandy,
        muddy, scummy water and you get sprayed with it for way longer. As soon
        as the rainy season begins, I make sure to equip my bike with some
        fenders.
      </p>

      <p>
        Cycling in the rain also increases my mental toughness and overall
        confidence.

        Physically, on a rainy bike ride, my body *suffers*. My fingers and
        toes, which are the hardest to keep dry and warm, start to lose feeling
        within a couple hours. At this point, it’s hard to stop because my
        fingers can’t press the brakes hard enough and getting off the bike is a
        tenuous situation because my feet don’t want to unclip from the pedals.
        Soaked cold and miserable, I just want to be home in my dry clothes next
        to a fire.
      </p>

      <p>
        But then I wake up the next day, and I feel like a hero.{" "}
        <em>I conquered that bike ride in the nasty weather!</em> When I did my
        second RTCC, it was during “The Great Storm of 2015” -- on top of the
        torrential downpour, I battled 80km per hr head-winds and manouvered
        around trees and powerlines that were falling down right before my eyes.
        I was just happy to be alive that day, but reflecting back I think “wow,
        if survived that, I can survive anything!”.
      </p>

      <p>
        Betters skills, stronger mind? What else can I get from cycling in the
        rain? This last one is a big one for me, especially since most of rainy
        rides have been in the name of raising awareness and funds for cancer
        research. Cancer is close to my heart - my favourite cousin from my
        childhood passed from cancer when he was only 30 and the initial
        motivation for me signing up. Perhaps fittingly enough, every RTCC I’ve
        done has been in rainy weather. So when the sun comes out, it’s a gift,
        and when I get to bike in the sun, I think of how lucky I am to be alive
        and enjoy this beautiful day on a bike.
      </p>

      <p>
        In conclusion, cycling in the rain, while dreadful in the moment, has
        numerous benefits including helping you to become a better biker, making
        you mentally stronger, and giving you more appreciation for sunny days
        and days where we can just ride, period. Next time it’s raining out,
        consider making yourself better.
